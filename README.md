# 🌐 English Language Learning Ability Prediction
---

## 📔 Introduction
Welcome to our project, "English Language Learning Ability Prediction", an innovative venture by a team of dedicated data scientists from the Master of Data Science program at the University of British Columbia. Our mission is to leverage cutting-edge machine learning techniques to predict how effectively individuals can learn English as a second language. This interdisciplinary project bridges the gap between data science and linguistic theory, offering valuable insights into language acquisition.
