    "In this report we attempt to build a prediction model using linear regression models to predict an individual’s English Proficiency Score based on factors such as age, education, and language background. Our final regression model used Ridge linear regression trained wth L2 regularization and was found to have an optimal alpha value of {glue:text}`ridge-best-alpha_cv:.6f`. The performance of our model was scored across two metrics - R-squared score and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Our model had a R-squared value of {glue:text}`best_test_score_r2:.4f`, indicating that {glue:text}`best_test_score_r2_percentage:.4f`% of the variance in the correct English Proficiency Score is associated with the features in our model and our RMSE of {glue:text}`best_test_rmse:.6f` suggested that, on average, our predictions have an error of {glue:text}`best_test_rmse_percentage:.4f`%. We analyzed the learned coefficients to determine the most. Looking at our predicted scores and the associated true English Proficiency Scores, we observed that our model performed better for higher actual English Proficiency Scores. This prediction could therefore be used in an informal setting for screening of proficiency based on certain factors - where the predicted score its just used as a baseline. The model may be useful in the initial analysis of individuals wanting to learn English - for example as a tool to allocate the appropriate amount of resources or suggest a certain level of guidance to an individual to best facilitate their English learning. We also interpreted the learned coefficients for our model which found that the most important features in our dataset associated with English Proficiency Scores is the `Eng_little` encoding which indicates the individual’s current level of English (e.g., native, immersion learner, non-immersion learner).\n"

    "From the results above ({numref}feat-coefs), we can see that the most important features in determining a high English Proficiency Score are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Eng_little_monoeng`: This is a binary column that indicates whether the participant is a native speaker of English or not. This is the most important feature associated with increasing the English Proficiency Score.\n",
    "- `Eng_little_bileng`: This is a binary column that indicates whether the participant is native speaker of English plus at least one other language. This is the second most important feature associated with increasing the English Proficiency Score.\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows that the most important feature in increasing the English Proficiency Score among this dataset is whether the participant is a native speaker of English or not. This is followed by whether the participant is a native speaker in both English and at least one other language - both of which make sense logically.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important features in lowering the English Proficiency Score are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Eng_little_lot`: This is a binary column that indicates whether the participant is an immersion learner.\n",
    "- `psychiatric`: This is a binary column that indicates whether the participant has any psychiatric disorders.\n",
    "- `Eng_little_little`: This is a binary column that indicates whether the participant is a non-immersion learner.\n",
    "\n",
    "This somewhat makes sense since the most important features in determining the test scores is the Eng_little encoding. If the person is a native speaker or a native speaker of English and at least one other language, they would have a higher test score. If the person is an immersion learner or a non-immersion learner, they would have a lower test score.\n"

    "We measured the performance of our model on the test data with our RMSE test score of {glue:text}`ridge-best-error-cv:.4f` ({glue:text}`ridge-best-error-percentage-cv:.2f`%). Our model performed well on the test data - which we can further visualize by plotting our predicted test English Proficiency Score values against our actual test English Proficiency Score values. From these numbers, we can make a couple general notes on our model performance. Our $R^2$ value of {glue:text}`best_test_score_r2:.4f` means that {glue:text}`best_test_score_r2_percentage:.2f`% of the variance in the `correct` English Proficiency Score is associated with the features (as illustrated in our coefficient table above) in our model. Additionally, our RMSE of {glue:text}`ridge-best-error-cv:.4f` suggests that, on average, our predictions have an error of {glue:text}`ridge-best-error-percentage-cv:.2f`%. We can further visualize the deviation of our predictions from the actual test scores by plotting our predicted test English Proficiency Score values against our actual test English Proficiency Score values.\n"

    "The scatterplot above ({numref}act-vs-pred) plots our predicted English Proficiency Scores from our Ridge model against the actual English Proficiency Scores. The dashed black line represents the \"perfect\" prediction where the predicted is equal to the actual score. We see that the majority of the examples are clustered in the upper right quadrant of the plot and appear to be closer to the diagonal line, veering further above the diagonal as the actual score value decreases. This indicates that the predicted scores are more accurate for the higher actual scores, and we tend to predict higher scores as the value of the actual score decreases. We can note from the plot above that our model appears to better predict higher English Proficiency Scores - varying significantly from the actual score for lower English Proficiency Scores.\n"

    "Considering the limitations noted above, our model may be useful in the initial analysis of individuals wanting to learn English as a second language to make an informal prediction on an estimated level of English Proficiency. This estimated English Proficiency Score could be used as a tool to allocate the appropriate amount of resources or suggest a certain level of guidance to an individual to best facilitate their English learning. This work could be further explored with a more in depth look at the feature importance and the correlation between specific features in the dataset and how they are associated with test scores. This could also be improved with feature selection to see which combination os features would be best used to help the model better predict test scores. Additionally, other regression models could be explored, such as KNN regression, to see if allowing for non-linear decision boundaries\n"
